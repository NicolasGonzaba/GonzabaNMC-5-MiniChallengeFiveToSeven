Mini Challenge Five to Seveen

I Designed 4 controllers with designated services inside an API. the first controller was an ad lib story with user inputs, the second controller told someone if a number is odd or even, The third controller could take a number and reverse it, and the last controller did the same with both numbers and letters, including validation.

Peer Review (Brandon Estrada): Your project is functional, I am able to retrieve the endpoints from your api along with my inputted values. Nice Job!
